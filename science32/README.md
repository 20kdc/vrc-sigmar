## Notes

Udon Assembly doesn't play as well as it could with import on the no-auto-import configuration. For this reason, you may have to manually delete the SerializedUdonProgram file to get it to recompile.

CURRENT BIG SCARY BUG: **Type signedness messes everything up because System.Convert is really, really picky.**
